# Crypto Conversion Library

This library is used to convert export-files of the following cryptocurrency exchanges into a bunch of tables:
- kraken.com
- binance.com (tbd)
- kucoin.com (tbd)

The purpose of the resulting tables is to:
- Have a clear overview of all deposits
- Have a clear overview of all withdrawals
- Know all trades done between currencies on a single exchange

These results can be used as a starting point for an analysis of
- Total investment in cryptocurrencies (all deposits)
- Total yield of cryptocurrency investments (withdrawals)
- Overview of your cryptocurrency portfolio by knowing in detail how many coins of each currency you currently hodl overall
- Tax: For tax statements you need to know how much profit you made when selling a coin and for how long you hodl'd it
